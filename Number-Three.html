      Individiuals can do relatively little to stop companies from taking advantage of tax-breaks and loopholes; however, voters can do much more. By voicing their concerns about what will happen if large corporations continue to get tax-breaks, people can force politicians to introduce stricter tax laws that prevent evasion. This could be difficult though because many politians either have little idea about the impacts of tax breaks, or they are actually paid by large companies. Since the only means of change is by the vote, change must be accomplished through dedicated agitating and lobbying. Many organizations exist to promote more uniform taxation. You can find resources by individual research or by clicking on the button below. The organization linked by the button below is called Americans for Tax Fairness and advocates for increased taxation on the very wealthy. It also has a veriety of articles about taxation inequality.
