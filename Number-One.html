    <p class="info">
      In 2016, 11.5 million documents owned by the accounting firm Mossack Fonesca were released by a whistleblower. The firm was one of the largest off-shore accounting firms in the world, meaning it primarily catered to the wealthy and influencial. As is the case with most accounting firms, basically everything was done via legal means. Despite this, the documents revealed the extent to which wealthy individuals could use convoluted tax bureaucracy to avoid paying taxes. While it isn't nessesarily bad that people are trying to pay less in taxes, it becomes a problem when only the wealthy can afford to get out of paying taxes. Even worse, those avoiding taxes are sometimes the ones levying those taxes, as was the case with the Icelandic Prime Minister who resigned following the his implication in tax evasion by leak. This information leak was called the Panama Papers, and its disclosure led to massive outcry. Despite this, relatively little has been done to limit the use of tax law to avoid paying taxes.
