      When large companies don't pay their taxes, it means that the government doesn't make as much money. In order to make this money back, the government has to levy taxes on the lower and middle class. As a result, the average person ends up losing money in order to cover the government's losses when corporations don't pay taxes. This furthers wealth inequality. During Covid-19, the government was engaged in massive defecit spending, having to print extraordinary amounts of money to lessen the burdern. Meanwhile, large companies such as Amazon, Netflix, and Zoom paid 9.4%, less than 1%, and 0% of their income respectively. In America, the economy is robust enough to scrape by even losing these funds, but in smaller, especially third-world, countries, those tax funds are vital to the country's economy. Essentially, a lack of corporate payment of taxes places a burden on the individual taxpayer and can cause economic instability, especially in poorer countries.
